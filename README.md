# Blockchain-Legislative-Data-Project
A research project of the Center for Law, Tech, and Social good, the Blockchain Legislative Definitions (BLD) Project is a repository of legal definitions used by state authorities. Unlike a regulatory tracker of proposed legislation to regulate blockchain or cryptocurrency, BLD focuses on language definitions in legislation.
